# POKEDEX

## Introduction

The Pokédex is a fictional technological device from the Pokémon universe.
It's used to catalog fictional creatures and store detailed information about each Pokémon.

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Pokédex system, along with a team management feature that allows Pokémon to be organized into teams.

The goal is to practice REST API creation and consuming it through an API client (REST Client).
